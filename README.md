# To-Do List Application
## Overview
### The To-Do List Application is a Python-based project designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This application can be developed as either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), providing flexibility based on user preferences. Users can create, update, and track their to-do lists effortlessly, ensuring they stay on top of their tasks and priorities.

## Features
- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- Update Tasks: Users can update existing tasks with new information or mark them as completed.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- View Tasks: Users can view all tasks in their to-do list, with options to filter by status (e.g., completed, pending).
- Prioritize Tasks: Users can set priorities for their tasks to manage them better.
- Save and Load: The application saves tasks to a file and loads them on startup to preserve the to-do list between sessions.
